# Resiliency

The three fundamental scalability patterns discussed so far:
 * functional decomposition - splitting a monolithic system into independent parts which composed provide the same functionality
 * data partitioning - splitting data across several nodes
 * replication - duplicating data across several nodes

All the patterns have one thing in common - they increase the number of moving parts in our system.
