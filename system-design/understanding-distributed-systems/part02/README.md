# Coordination

So far, focus is on making nodes communicate. Focus now is to make nodes coordinate as if they're a single coherent system.

## System Models
To reason about distributed systems, we must strictly define what can and cannot happen.

A system model is a set of assumptions about the behavior of processes, communication links and timing while abstracting away the complexities of the technology being used.

Some common models for communication links:
 * fair-loss link - messages may be lost and duplicated, but if sender keeps retransmitting messages, they will eventually be delivered.
 * reliable link - messages are delivered exactly once without loss or duplication. Reliable links can be implemented on top of fair-loss links by deduplicating messages at receiving end.
 * authenticated reliable link - same as reliable link but also assumes the receiver can authenticate the sender.

Although these models are abstractions of real communication links, they are useful to verify the correctness of algorithms.

We can also model process behavior based on the types of failures we can expect:
 * arbitrary-fault model - aka "Byzantine" model, the process can deviate from algorithm in unexpected ways, leading to crashes due to bugs or malicious activity.
 * crash-recovery model - process doesn't deviate from algorithm, but can crash and restart at any time, losing its in-memory state.
 * crash-stop model - process doesn't deviate from algorithm, it can crash and when it does, it doesn't come back online. Used to model unrecoverable hardware faults.

The arbitrary-fault model is used to describe systems which are safety-criticla or not in full control of all the processes - airplanes, nuclear power plants, the bitcoin digital currency.

This model is out of scope for the book. Algorithms presented mainly focus on the crash-recovery model.

Finally, we can model timing assumptions:
 * synchronous model - sending a message or executing an operation never takes more than a certain amount of time. Not realistic for the kinds of systems we're interested in.
    * Sending messages over the network can take an indefinite amount of time. Processes can also be slowed down by garbage collection cycles.
 * asynchronous model - sending a message or executing an operation can take an indefinite amount of time.
 * partially synchronous model - system behaves synchronously most of the time. Typically representative enough of real-world systems.

Throughout the book, we'll assume a system model with fair-loss links, crash-recovery processes and partial synchrony.
