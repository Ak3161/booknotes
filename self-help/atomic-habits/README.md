## The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits
The UK cycling team went from absolute noobs to winning championships in 5y all thanks to some coach who focused on the team improving via micro habits, which stack up over time.

Examples:
 * Experimented with different fabric for the outfits which are more aerodynamic
 * Tried different massages to optimize for fastest muscle recovery
 * Optimized hand-washing to minimize players getting a cold

Why does this work? Because of compounding, famously expressed via the formula 1.01^365 = 37.78, ie 1% improvement every day.

On the flip-side, getting 1% worse every day (0.99^365) results in 00.03.

Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. They seem to make little difference day to day, but deliver massive impact over months & years.

Unfortunately, the slow velocity results in us underestimating the effect of both good and bad habits:
 * We tend to skip workouts
 * We tend to binge-watch netflix or eat a lot

We do this because short-term positive and negative impact is minimal, but that's not the case in the long-term.

**Key takeaway** - focus on putting yourself on the path to success, not on being successful. Focus on your trajectory, rather than current results.

The effect of habits is similar to the behavior of a melting cube. 
While the temperature in a room is increasing, the ice cube seemingly stays in tact, but at some point, a 1 degree increase leads to the cube melting.

Breakthrough moments are the result of many previous actions that build up the potential for a major change. Habits work similarly.

This is one of the core reasons people don't stick to habits - they don't have the patience to wait for the breakthrough because they expect linear gains.

The author refers to the time before a breakthrough as **the plateau of latent potential**.

**Forget about goals, focus on systems.**

Goals are about the results you want to achieve, systems are about the processes that lead to those results.

Goals make sense for setting direction, but systems are best for making progress towards that direction.

Problems with goal-setting:
 * Winners and losers share the same goals - survivorship-bias kicks in. Only a handful of goal-setters succeeded and those are the ones we see. We don't see the dozens of failures.
 * Achieving a goal is a momentary change - by achieving a goal, you're treating a symptom, not the root cause. You can clean your room once, but you need a system to keep it tidy over time.
 * Goals restrict your happiness - you defer happiness until you reach your goal, after which you defer for the next one. Enjoying the process lets you be happy while your system is running.
 * Goals are at odds with long-term progress - once you reach your goal, there's nothing motivating you to keep going. Goal-setting focus is winning the game, systems focus is to continue playing it.

**You don't rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.**

**Atomic** habits are partially about creating tiny habits, but also, they're meant to be the atoms of something bigger, the building blocks of remarkable results.

## How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
It's often difficult to keep up with good habits or prevent yourself from doing bad habits for more than a few days.

The reason we fail to change our habits is for two reasons:
 * We try to change the wrong thing
 * We try to change our habits in the wrong way

This chapter addresses the former issue, the rest of the chapters focus on the latter.

### Three Layers of Behavior Change
![onion-layers](images/onion-layers.png)

A change can occur at three layers.
 * Outcomes (what you get) - changing results, ie losing weight, winning a championship, publishing a book
 * Process (what you do) - changing your habits and systems, starting a new gym routine, decluttering workplace, etc
 * Identity (what you believe) - changing your beliefs, self-image, judgements, biases, etc

Neither level is better or worse. The issue is with the direction of change we attempt.
![direction-of-change](images/direction-of-change.png)

Former builds outcome-based habits. These people focus on what they want to achieve.

Latter builds identity-based habits. These people focus on who they wish to become.

Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.

Examples:
 * you want more money but if your identity is of one who consumes, rather than create, that will not happen
 * you want better health but if you continue to prioritize comfort over accomplishment, that will not happen

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. 
If you take pride in the outcomes you achieve by sticking to a habit, you'll fight hard to maintain your habits.

Focus on changing your identity, not achieving a particular goal:
 * Don't aim for reading a book, aim for becoming a reader
 * Don't aim for running a marathon, aim to become a runner
 * Don't aim to learn an instrument, aim to become a musician

This is a double-edged sword. If your identity is working against you, it is a curse:
 * "I'm not a morning person"
 * "I'm always late"
 * "I'm horrible at math"

Over time, you start resisting certain actions because they are against your identity.

### The Two-Step Process To Changing Your Identity
Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every belief is learned and conditioned through experience.

You believe things about your identity because you have proof of it.
 * You go to church every sunday for 20 years - you have proof you're religious
 * You study biology for 1h every night - you have proof you're studious 
 * You go to the gym when it's snowing - you have proof you are committed to working out

You habits are not the only thing reinforcing your identity but it's usually the most important one.

The effect of one-off experiences fades away while the effect of habits gets reinforced with time.

Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. 
No single instance of working out will make you an athlete, but working out continuously will.

Meaningful change does not need radical change. Small habits make a meaningful difference by being applied over time.

Each habit not only gets results, but more importantly, teaches you to trust yourself. 
When the votes of change mount up, you start to believe you're a different person.

It works in the opposite direction as well unfortunately. However, note that it's normal to have votes in opposite directions.

You don't win the election by having unanimous votes, you win by having the majority.

Decide who you want to be. It's okay to start from the results you want, but work backwards to figure out what type of person you have to become that will achieve those results.

Once that's settled, begin taking small, consistent steps, that will take you in that direction.

The formation of habits is a feedback loop - your habits shape your identity and your identity shapes your habits.

It's important to let your habits, principles and values drive that loop, not your results.

### The Real Reason Habits Matter
The first step in behavior change is not what or how. It is who - who you want to become.

The real reason habits matter is not what you can achieve through them, but what you can become through them.

You become your habits.

## How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps
Behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated.
Those that produce unpleasant consequences tend not to.

This is demonstrated by a story about an experiment with cats where a cat was put in a closed box, which opens when you push a button.
Initially, the cats tend to do random actions until they accidentally stumble upon the button. 
Over time, they tend to improve and eventually, start solving the task in a few seconds.

### Why Your Brain Builds Habits
A habit is a behavior repeated enough to become automatic. Building a habit begins by trial and error. During this time, brain activity is significant.

Once you stumble upon a solution that works for you, you start gravitating towards repeating it. The more you do it, the easier it becomes.

Examples - you feel anxious after work and you learn that playing video games/going for a run/etc calms you down.

Once you learn that you enjoy a certain outcome, your brain starts reverse engineering the actions which took you there and removing unneeded ones to optimize the process.

To sum it up - habits are reliable solutions to reoccurring problems.

It is a very useful optimization due to the fact that the brain's conscious mind can only focus on one thing at the time. 
It likes delegating some activities to the unconscious one which can work in the background. That's where habits go to.

Some people worry that building too many habits make your life dull & automatic. On the contrary, building habits complements attaining freedom.

Examples:
 * Without good financial habits, you will be struggling for every dollar
 * Without good health habits, you will always be short on energy
 * Without good learning habits, you will always be behind others

If you constantly need to make decisions about simple tasks, ie when should I work out, when do I pay the bills, etc, then you will have less time for freedom.

### The Science of How Habits Work
The process of building a habit can be divided into four parts - Cue, Craving, Response, Reward.
![habit-building-stages](images/habit-building-stages.png)

This is the backbone of every habit and your brain runs through these steps in order every time.

The cue is a trigger which initiates the behavior - a bit of information that predicts a reward.

In the past, the cues signaled the location of food, water, sex. 
Nowadays, the cues predict secondary rewards, ie money and fame, power and status, praise and approval, etc.

These pursuits also indirectly improve our odds of survival and reproduction, which is the greater motive behind what we do.

A cue leads to craving. That's the motivational force behind every habit. Without some motivation or desire, we have no reason to act.
What you crave is not the habit itself, but the reward it provides, ie you don't crave smoking a cigarette, but the relief it provides.

Cravings differ from person to person. The sounds of slot machines spark a desire in gamblers, but are just background noise to non-gamblers.

The third step is the response - the actual habit you perform. It can be a thought or an action.

Whether the response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is involved.

If an action requires more effort than you are willing to expend, you won't do it. 
It also depends on your ability - if you want to dunk a basketball but are not high enough to do it, you won't do it.

Finally, the response delivers a reward. That's the end goal of every habit. We chase rewards because they either satisfy us or they teach us.

Rewards provide benefits on their own, ie getting a promotion gets you more money or respect, but the more immediate benefit is that rewards satisfy your craving to eat or gain status.

Additionally, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future. Your brain constantly monitors for rewards which satisfy your cravings and deliver pleasure.
That's what helps your brain distinguish useful actions from useless ones.

If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit:
 * no cue => behavior will never start
 * reduce craving => no willingness to start
 * make it difficult => you won't be able to do it
 * reward is not satisfying => no reason to do it again

### The Habit Loop
![habit-loop](images/habit-loop.png)

The cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which becomes associated with the cue.

These four steps form a feedback loop, that enable you to create automatic habits. This cycle happens continuously at all times.

The steps can be split in two - the problem phase and the solution phase. Several examples:
 * your phone buzzes (cue), you want to learn message contents (craving), you grab your phone (response), you satisfy your curiosity (reward)
 * you are answering emails (cue), you feel stressed and overwhelmed (craving), you bite your nails (response), you reduce your stress (reward)

By the time we are adults, we rarely notice the habits that are running our lives.

### The Four Laws of Behavior Change
In the following chapters, we'll see a dozen examples of how these four steps dictate our lives.

Before we do that, we need to transform these steps into a practical framework we can use to design good habits and eliminate bad ones.

How to make good habits: 
 * make it obvious (cue)
 * make it attractive (craving)
 * make it easy (response)
 * make it satisfying (reward)

Let's invert those to see how to stop bad habits:
 * make it invisible (cue)
 * make it unattractive (craving)
 * make it difficult (response)
 * make it unsatisfying (reward)

These laws apply to nearly any field. Whenever you want to change your behavior, you can use those tools to achieve your goal.

Whenever you fail to form a good habit or remove a bad one, the answer typically lies somewhere above, in those four steps.
Every goal is doomed to fail if it goes against human nature.

Your habits are shaped by the systems in your life.
