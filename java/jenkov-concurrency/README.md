## Introduction
### What is Multithreading
Multithreading == multiple threads of execution inside a single program.
A multithreaded application is as if you have multiple CPUs executing your code at once.

However, threads != CPUs. Usually, a single CPU will share its execution time with multiple threads.

### Why Multithreading?
#### Better utilization of a single CPU
e.g. whilst one thread is waiting for input from a network, another one can run during this time.

#### Better utilization of multiple CPUs
If your computer has multiple CPUs then you'd need to use threads to fully utilize them.

#### Better UX in terms of responsiveness
A blocking operation (e.g. downloading a photo) in a UI should not cause the whole UI to stall. This can be achieved by having the UI be handled on a separate thread.

#### Better UX in terms of fairness
If one client's request takes too much time, the rest of the clients' requests should proceed.

### Multithreading vs. Multitasking
In the past, computers with a single CPU were able to execute only one program at a time.
This changed with the advent of multitasking.

#### Multitasking
Multitasking enables you to execute multiple programs at a time with a single CPU.
